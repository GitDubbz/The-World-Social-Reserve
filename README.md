# The-World-Social-Reserve-System
World Central Foundation &amp; Transparent Economy

This repository is for understanding the structure of repositories and to create an "idea repository" for The World Social Reserve System.  Ideas (Posts, Tweets etc.) will be created by a user which can then be developed publicly or privately independently or through collaborations with other users within the platform. Along with consolidated economic, information and social architecture, The World Social Reserve System will be able to use transparency to optimize game theory within society, to help evolve the world economies to reasonably concentrate resources to high impact social initiatives. These social initiatives will be executed by not-for-profit charities and will be primarily positioned towards the education infrastructure. The "conscious public" (users within this online community) will "crowd" develop and direct these initiatives. Highly successful social initiatives will later be set up as Digital Autonomous Corporations (DAC), which will use bitcoin "blockchaining" technology to distributed the resources to their proper locations.
